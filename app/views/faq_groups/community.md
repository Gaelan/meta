# How can I get to know other Assembly community members?

The best way to do this is to become an active member. Introduce yourself to the team working on a project you like, and see how you can help. Collaboration is what makes Assembly special, and youâ€™ll start to see that as soon as you start working side-by-side with great people.

Pro-tip Assembly supports both [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and Emoji site wide.
